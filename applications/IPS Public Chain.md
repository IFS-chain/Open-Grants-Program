# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** IPS Public Chain
* **Team Name:**　IPS
* **Payment Address:** BTC:3Au6iWhC3c3DfTT76upm3jGLd6Ra5Gk1CX    
* 　　　　　　　　　　　　DAI:0xFe70C536D0479EF64512221a78F6AF75fE6E428d


### Overview

  IPS aims to build a public chain with storage capablity. The public chain will be a kind of P2P model with allow people could provide their spare hardware resoure to earn money. Meanwhile customers could get storage with lower cost. 
  
  IPS is a high-performance public chain built against P2P distributed storage. P2P distributed storage not only provides a safe, reliable, and low-cost storage platform. Anyone can freely use the P2P distributed storage provided by IPS while defining smart contracts. IPS aims to achieve efficient node governance on the chain based on multi-chain and multi-consensus, combined with verifiable storage proof and token economy. The goal of IPS is to build a new type of distributed encrypted storage network, provide users with efficient storage services, and build a functionally-rich distributed application (DApp) on the chain on this basis.
  
  IPS will integrate with Substrate then join the Polkadot as a Parachain.
  
### Project Details 

IPS will provide a variety of infrastructures for all participants:
 - P2P cloud storage service based on the sharing economy model
 - P2P data trading platform connected to data
 - P2P to centralize the Internet: domain name system and browser under the IPS protocol
 - Go to the centralization service and content platform
 - Blockchain: high-performance public chain, self-defined private chain
 - Digital currency based on decentralization and interconnection.

The architecture of the IPS is as below

### Ecosystem Fit 

We are willing to play a parachain role in the ecosystem. Our targeted customers will be NFT assets stroage then extend to other areas. Our team is from Japan. When we talk to people who are running NFT business in Japan, they are very interested in the project and show the intention to use our storage. We belive we could bring a high quality and robust product to the ecosystem. 

In addition, we could extend the Web3 ecosystem in Japan then other countries .
